Project Title ATM Interface

   -The Project is an ATM/Banking interface that allows people to manage and edit a bank account.
---

Description

   -The project incorporates a connection to a database that allows users to create accounts and connect to the account to make deposits transfers and withdrawals all on a computer. 
   -We used a database connection for storing user data because it allows for accounts to be added, saved, and used later in the projects life. This makes it feel like a real experience of creating an account unique to a user.
