Project Title ATM Interface

Description

   -The project incorporates a connection to a database that allows users to create accounts and connect to the account to make deposits transfers and withdrawals all on a computer. 
   
   -We used a database connection for storing user data because it allows for accounts to be added, saved, and used later in the projects life. This makes it feel like a real experience of creating an account unique to a user. 
   
   -We also used scene builder to create navigable interfaces to allow easy use of the ATM/Banking program. They allow for buttons to be used to navigate and edit account data or even just log on to view balances.

How to use the project. 

-Download the zip file and copy the source contents to eclipse and run the App.java to view and use the interface. 

-If you are a new user, you can create an account in the bottom right by clicking on the “Sign Up” button, This will bring you to the sign up scene that will ask for a new account ID and pin for the account. This will be the access info for that account. 

-Once the account is created you can type in the account login info and click sign in to view the dashboard. This is where you can view the account balance and pending deposit balance. Also, you can add funds by depositing or remove them by withdrawing. You will also be able to transfer money by hitting the transfer button. 

-If you want to deposit money, simply click the deposit button. You can than type in a custom amount of money to deposit or select one of the premade buttons to enter a predetermined amount. Then simply hit confirm and your money will be set to pending. When one day goes by (or one restart of the program to simulate a day) the funds will be settled. 

-Withdrawing is the same thing as depositing but there are more restrictions and checks to make sure that you have the money that you would be withdrawing

-When you are done with the application you can simply log out of it to close the session.
